# Debugging Shell Scripts

Today, I learned how to debug shell scripts using `bash -x` and `shellcheck`. 

`bash -x` is a built-in bash command that prints each command that is going to be executed to the terminal before it is executed. This is particularly useful for understanding the flow of a script and identifying any errors or unexpected behavior. To use it, simply prepend `bash -x` to the script you want to debug, like so: 

```bash
bash -x your-script.sh
```

On the other hand, `shellcheck` is a powerful tool that can detect potential issues in your shell scripts and provide suggestions for improvements. It can be installed on most Unix-like operating systems and used as follows:

```bash
shellcheck your-script.sh
```

These tools are invaluable for writing robust, error-free shell scripts. I'm glad to have added them to my development toolkit.
