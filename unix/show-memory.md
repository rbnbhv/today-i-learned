# Show memory of a folder 

- The disk usage program shows the space occupied by the files it has named (or, in the case of each directory, recursively by all the files it contains). If you don't name it a file, it examines the current working directory.

- s = summarized all folders

- The df command, on the other hand, displays the free space.

``` du -sh . ```

``` df ```
