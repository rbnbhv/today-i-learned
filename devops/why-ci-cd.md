## Why should you use ci/cd?

- Shopware is indeed a testing-friendly platform and that's something I personally love it. 
- Testing in general bring great value to businesses, especially on the long-term, as they make sure code works as intended. 
- If code is not covered by tests, an infinity of bugs can be accidentally shipped to production, making businesses lose piles of money. 
- All theses loses could be easily mitigated with simple testing coverage.

### Benefits by adopting testing on your Shopware store:

1. Shopware needs to be upgraded few times a year and if you don't have your plugins covered by tests, you will certainly miss to test specific points that might break production badly. Ensure your custom plugins will continue to work and be compatible with future Shopware versions.

2. Upgrades will be become more and more a pain in the neck, as your project grows. With automated testing, it will not be a huge issue, because tests are written once and can be run as many times as wanted. If something breaks, that's all fine, you will know in the development phase.
