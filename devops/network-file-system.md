# What is the NFS

The Network File System (NFS) is a mechanism for storing files on a network. It is a distributed file system that allows users to access files and directories located on remote computers and treat those files and directories as if they were local.

For example, users can use operating system commands to create, remove, read, write, and set file attributes for remote files and directories.

The NFS enables system administrators to share all or a portion of a file system on a networked server to make it accessible to remote computer users. Clients with authorization to access the shared file system can mount NFS shares, also known as shared file systems.
