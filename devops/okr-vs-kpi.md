# OKR vs KPI

- OKRs and KPIs are both performance management methods, but they can be useful in different ways in achieving your goals
- OKRs form a framework for setting goals, while KPIs make the implementation of the set goals measurable and traceable.
- both serve and support the definition of project goals

## OKR

- With the Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), corporate goals are linked to measurable measures to achieve these goals
- OKRs can be used for almost any goal, whether it's a long-term career goal, a quarterly team goal, or a personal goal

### Goals include anything you want to achieve, whether they're easily achievable or more ambitious. An objective can include something like:

- Improving customer loyalty
- Increasing the conversion rate of our website
- Generation of qualified leads

### Key results are measurable factors that you want to use to achieve your goal. You can define more than one key result for each goal. A key result can include things like:
- Introduction of a loyalty rewards program
- Supplementing our website with quality content
- Upgrade our CRM software


## KPI
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are quantitative success indicators that can be used to track company goals or projects
- You can use KPIs to track projects, programs or any other business initiative

### Establish KPIs that meet the following criteria:

- Link to your strategic goals
- Measurability using benchmarks
- Resource planning is informed
