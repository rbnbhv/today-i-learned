## What is angularJS?

- AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps.
- It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly

## Why should you use it?
- HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.

## Advantages of angularJS
- Dependency Injection: 
  - Dependency Injection specifies a design pattern in which components are given their dependencies instead of hard coding them within the component.
- Two way data binding: 
  - AngularJS creates a two way data-binding between the select element and the orderProp model. orderProp is then used as the input for the orderBy filter.
- Testing: 
  - Angular JS is designed in a way that we can test right from the start. So, it is very easy to test any of its components through unit testing and end-to-end testing.
- Model View Controller: 
  - In Angular JS, it is very easy to develop application in a clean MVC way. You just have to split your application code into MVC components i.e. Model, View and the Controller.
