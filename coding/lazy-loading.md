## What is Lazy Loading

- Lazy loading is a design pattern
  In software development, lazy loading refers to a design pattern in which data objects always provide values or other dependent objects, but only fetch them from the data source when there is a specific request.

## Eager loading
- The opposite is referred to as "eager loading"; all foreseeable required data is fetched as efficiently as possible.
