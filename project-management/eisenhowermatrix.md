# Eisenhowermatrix

- The Eisenhower Matrix is a time management method to different between important and unimportant, urgent and non-urgent tasks. 
- The goal of the Eisenhower Matrix is to sort and prioritize tasks according to their importance and urgency. It is about "not doing things right, but "doing the right things". Thus, it is a tool to increase effectiveness ("doing the right things") and not a tool to increase efficiency ("doing things right").


#### In order to sort and prioritize tasks, two questions need to be answered for each task:
  - How important is the task?
  - How urgent is the task?
