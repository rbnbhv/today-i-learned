## Dockware 

- Dockware is a Docker Setup for Shopware 6. It offers the advantage over Docker that it should take away the DevOps complexity.
  Three Dockware images are provided for this purpose:

### Dockware/play:
- its very easy to test / here you can explore a Shopware 6 environment

### Dockware/dev:
- As the name suggests, this is the perfect way to develop in Shopware6. Many developer tools (e.g. Xdebug, Adminer) are provided here

### Dockware/contribute:
- Docker/contribute is a simple plug and play solution. If you want to try something in the code in a short time, you can do it here. A set-up demo shop, which will be available in a short time, can be tested directly using a pull request that has already been prepared.

### Dockware/essentials:
- the essentials image comes without a shopware 6 shop, but you can you it for easy building an environment
