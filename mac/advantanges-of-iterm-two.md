## Advantages of iterm2 over terminal

- Last week i switched from terminal to iterm2.
- iterm2 has a lot of nice advantages over terminal. For me the main advantages are:
- you have tmux included and its even better, with cmd+d you can split or cmd+shift+d you can split vertical.
  - with cmd+alt+cursor you can switch the windows
- you can set very easy and good a lot of preferences if you want.
- you can copy mouseless
- the search will highlight all found words (like in Chrome and Safari)
- if you use ls you can click on the folder/file and it will open in finder

#### And there are even a lot more features :)
