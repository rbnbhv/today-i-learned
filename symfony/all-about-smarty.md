- Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic. 
- This implies that PHP code is application logic, and is separated from the presentation.

## Some of Smarty’s features:

- You can easily create your own custom functions and variable modifiers, so the template language is extremely extensible.
- Configurable template {delimiter} tag syntax, so you can use {$foo}, {{$foo}}, <!--{$foo}-->, etc.
- The {if}..{elseif}..{else}..{/if} constructs are passed to the PHP parser, so the {if...} expression syntax can be as simple or as complex an evaluation as you like.
- Allows unlimited nesting of sections, if’s etc.
- Built-in caching support.
- Arbitrary template sources.
- Template Inheritance for easy management of template content.
- Plugin architecture.
